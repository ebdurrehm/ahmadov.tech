## Introduction

Rust is a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety. It is designed to be a safe, concurrent, and practical language.

## Why Rust?

Rust offers several advantages over other programming languages:

- **Memory Safety**: Rust ensures memory safety without using a garbage collector.
- **Concurrency**: Rust's ownership model guarantees thread safety.
- **Performance**: Rust is as fast as C and C++.

## Getting Started

To get started with Rust, you need to install the Rust compiler and the Cargo build system. You can do this by following the instructions on the [official Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

## Example Code

Here is a simple example of a Rust program:
